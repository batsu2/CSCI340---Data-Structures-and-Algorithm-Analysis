For this computer assignment, I wrote and implement a C++ program to simulate and solve the Josephus problem.

The input to the program is the number M and a list of N names, which is clockwise ordering of the circle, beginning with 
the person from whom the count is to start. After each removal, the program should print the names of all people in the circle
until only one person remains. However, to save the printing space, only the names of the remaining people only after K elimination are printed,
where K â‰¥ 1 is also an input argument to the program. The input arguments N, M and K can be entered from the stdin in the given order.
