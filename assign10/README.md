For this computer assignment, I wrote a C++ program to implement several graph algorithms on weighted digraphs. 
The main() routine creates a digraph for the default size of NO_NODES (defined in the header file wdigraph.h)
and then creates two other digraphs of sizes N2 = 5 and N3 = 20. For all cases, it calls the subroutine proc_graph()
to test the member functions of wgraph.
